An auditor by day, a coder by night! I work as an auditor at a public university in Virginia, USA, and am a former Big 4 auditor. I enjoy fooling around with computer software and operating systems, coding, journaling, writing fiction, reading, and speding time in the forest!

- ðŸ’¾ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple different little projects:
    - The first is a tool to automate downloading my eBook library on Amazon, and check my book list for when book prices are low
    - The second is a tool to pull AccuWeather data from the terminal so you don't have to go to the site to get your weather
- ðŸ˜¼ Iâ€™m currently working on getting better at Python and have built a couple projects using Python and Selenium
- âŒ¨ The languages I know inlcude the following:
    - Python
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
- ðŸ“š Check out my blog if you are interested in reading my fictional short stories, or would like to view the books I read
