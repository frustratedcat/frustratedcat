I work as an auditor at a public university in Virginia, USA. I enjoy fooling around with computer software and operating systems, coding, journaling, writing fiction, reading, and speding time in the forest!

- ðŸ˜¼ Iâ€™m currently working on getting better at Python
- âŒ¨ The languages I know inlcude the following:
    - Python
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Enough Lua for my neovim config
    - SQL
    - Markdown (if that counts)
- ðŸ“š Check out my blog if you are interested in reading my fictional short stories, or would like to view the books I read
